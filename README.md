####  XTRABYTES Consolidated Interactive TErminal

XCITE is the core application utilizing the XTRABYTES Proof-of-Signature blockchain protocol. Built to support modules like a decentralized exchange and a fully-integrated chat protocol, the SHA512 encrypted network is quantum resistant and lightning fast. The code-fluid architecture means any developer looking to make a third-party DApp can use the XTRABYTES API to build out their dream project. XCITE is poised to be a top contender in all-in-one decentralized applications.

## Getting Started

#### Install Qt

XCITE development requires the Qt cross-platform framework. If you don't have Qt installed you can download it from [here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) for free.

Our development is currently targeting Qt 5.10.1. When the Qt installer asks which Qt components to install, select the following components and a compiler suitable to your development environment:

- Qt 5.10.1 -> Qt Charts (Required)
- Qt 5.10.1 -> MinGW 5.3.0 32 bit  (Windows compiler)
- Tools -> MinGW 5.3.0 (Windows compiler)
- Qt 5.10.1 -> macOS (Mac components)
- Qt 5.10.1 -> iOS (iOS components)
- Qt 5.10.1 -> Android ARMv7 (Android physical device components)
- Qt 5.10.1 -> Android x86 (Android virtual device components)

After installing Qt, clone this repository and open xcite.pro using Qt Creator.

#### Project Configuration (Android)

Prerequisites for Android deployment:

- [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (v6 or later) 
- [Android Software Development Kit (SDK)](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
- [Android Native Development Kit (NDK)](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/)

In the Qt project, choose the Android kit that corresponds to your target device: 

- Android for ARM if using physical device
- Android for x86 if using an emulator

In Qt Options --> Devices --> Android, confirm that the prerequisite paths are correct. Once finished, your project configuration should have the following appearance and you should be able to select the necessary kit:

#### Qt Troubleshooting Advice

QMake is a fundamental part of Qt that serves the function of creating a make file. QMake not installing properly is usually attributed to user error and can be simply solved. If you run into a QMake issue during your Qt installation process follow these troubleshooting tips.

If this issue arises you should first try the following steps before performing a reinstallation of Qt:

1. Ensure antivirus did not keep QMake from installing during the installation process

2. Ensure proper Kit is selected/detected by going to Tools --> Options --> Build & Run --> Kits

- If no kit is selected or all kits are errored out, you will need to either manually install a kit or perform  a
        reinstallation.

3. Ensure a compiler is installed by checking Tools --> Options --> Build & Run --> Compilers

- If no compiler is installed you will need to either reinstall or manually install MinGW version 5.3.0

## Interacting with the XBY Testnet

**Please note that the Testnet is currently offline until we're ready for Testnet 4.**

1. Download the normal testnet wallet [here](https://testnet.xtrabytes.global/)
2. Run the testnet wallet and allow it to completely synchronize.
3. Close the wallet and browse to your application data folder.
     - **Windows:** %APPDATA%\xcite\
     - **Mac:** Home/Library/Application Support/xcite/
4. Within this folder, create a new file and name it "xcite.conf". **Make sure the file is not called "xcite.config.txt". The file must be saved with a ".conf" extension.**
     - **Windows:** In Notepad, go to File -> Save As ->  Set the "File name:" to xcite.conf, change the "Save as type:" dropdown to "All Files", then click Save.
     - **Mac:** In TextEdit, click Format in the file bar -> Make Plain Text -> File ->Save -> Change "Save As:" to xcite.conf, then click Save.
4. Edit the xcite.conf file, paste the following content into the file, then save and close it:

     ```
     rpcuser=xcite
     rpcpassword=xtrabytes
     server=1
     ```

5. Re-open the wallet and allow it to synchronize.
6. Open XCITE (allow the XCITE wallet to continue running in the background)
7. In XCITE, click the online indicator in the bottom-left to connect via RPC. If it works correctly the balance should be updated in XCITE and the Send Coins & History views should be functional.
